        <h2>Step-by-Step Percentage Calculation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Identify the Initial Value:</strong> Determine the initial value from which you want to subtract a percentage. This can be any numerical value, such as the price of a product or the total amount in a calculation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Determine the Percentage:</strong> Decide on the percentage you want to subtract to the initial value. For example, let's say you want to subtract 15% from the initial value.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Convert the Percentage to Decimal:</strong> Convert the percentage to decimal form by dividing it by 100. In our example, 15% would become 0.15 (15 ÷ 100 = 0.15).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Calculate the Decrease:</strong> Multiply the initial value by the decimal equivalent of the percentage. This will give you the decrease amount. For instance, if the initial value is 100 and you want to subtract 15%, you would multiply 100 by 0.15, resulting in 15 (200 * 0.15 = 15).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Subtract the Decrease from the Initial Value:</strong> Subtract the decrease amount calculated in the previous step from the initial value. This will give you the final result. Using our example, you would subtract 15 from 100, resulting in 170 (100 - 15 = 85).
            </li>
        </ol>

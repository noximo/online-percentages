        <h2>Step-by-Step Percentage Calculation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Identify the Initial Value:</strong> Determine the initial value to which you want to add a percentage. This can be any numerical value, such as the price of a product or the total amount in a calculation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Determine the Percentage:</strong> Decide on the percentage you want to add to the initial value. For example, let's say you want to add 15% to the initial value.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Convert the Percentage to Decimal:</strong> Convert the percentage to decimal form by dividing it by 100. In our example, 15% would become 0.15 (15 ÷ 100 = 0.15).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Calculate the Increase:</strong> Multiply the initial value by the decimal equivalent of the percentage. This will give you the increase amount. For instance, if the initial value is 200 and you want to add 15%, you would multiply 200 by 0.15, resulting in 30 (200 * 0.15 = 30).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add the Increase to the Initial Value:</strong> Add the increase amount calculated in the previous step to the initial value. This will give you the final result. Using our example, you would add 30 to 200, resulting in 230 (200 + 30 = 230).
            </li>
        </ol>
